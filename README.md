My first ever try to build a game using resources from the Ultimate Guide to Game Development from GameDevHQ

I do not own the audio, sprites or animations from this application, this is just my approach on code/folder structure from the course mentioned above.

This is my first ever video game code and as such, there might be a lot of room to improve, please do not consider this as part of my experience as I was spoon feeded a lot of its content.
